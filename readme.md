Sample ToDo App
-----

This app was not written by me, it was modified to latest version of knockout, jquery and etc plus few other small changes.

Purpose of this repro is to give base solution for learning setting up automation of deployment/build process including tests.

Orginal app was created by Gustavo Javier Machado based on Jérôme Gravel-Niquet backbone.js version. github url: https://github.com/machadogj/localtodos-ko

OLD README
-----
Localtodos-ko is a knockout version of the http://localtodos.com sample originally done in backbone.js by Jérôme Gravel-Niquet.

The sample has been done using Test First TDD technique using qunit as a testing framework. This sample is intended to show knockout.js best practices.
